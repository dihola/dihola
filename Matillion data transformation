ðŸš€ Data Transformation Pipeline Using Matillion & AWS S3
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to build a data transformation pipeline using Matillion, AWS S3.
## ðŸ”§ Workflow
**Data Ingestion**:  
The Excel file is uploaded to an AWS S3 bucket (s3://isaclient/Bank_Churn_Messy (1).xlsx).
Matillion reads the file from S3 and loads it into a staging table.

**Data Transformation (Matillion)**:  
Used the calculations function to Concatenate Frist_name and Last_Name.
Used rank fuction to filter the data in an Ascending format.
Used filter fuction to identify duplicate data.
Applies custom transformations.
Transformed data can be Stored in a data warehouse (e.g. Snowflake, Redshift, BigQuery).

**Data Output**:  
The final dataset is written back to S3 or a database.
Matillion triggers an ETL job orchestration.

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used
Matillion (ETL transformation)
AWS S3 (Data storage)
IAM (Access control)
SQL (Optional Data processing)
Python (Optional orchestration)

## SQL QUERY that could be used
-- Merge Firstname and Surname into FullName
SELECT 
    CONCAT(Firstname, ' ', Surname) AS FullName,
    Email,
    PhoneNumber
FROM customers;

-- Identify and remove duplicate customers based on Email
WITH ranked_customers AS (
    SELECT *, 
           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY Email ORDER BY CustomerID) AS row_num
    FROM customers
)
DELETE FROM customers
WHERE row_num > 1;
